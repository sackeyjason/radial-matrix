## Plants

- Mechanic inspired by Starseed Pilgrim
- Seeds are alternative pieces. They are 1x1 blocks.
- They can be planted in blocks. That is, they get embedded inside the block they land on, or are pushed inside from the side
- They can't be planted on the same sort of plant, or on the outer edge of the grid. In they land here, they don't grow. They just settle as dead matter.
- Various seed types have different plant growth patterns
- Plant growth halts piece-spawning until growth is complete, and until any clearing consequences complete: plants may complete rows
- Row completion due to plant-growth earns bonus points
